### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a quiet patient stubborn guy, as the most developers has to be in some degree. I've been working with web development since 2004, but still aware that there are too many things to learn.

I'm a husband and a father of two. It's also helpful being quiet, patient, and stubborn guy on that front as well.

### User manual

_Here are some ways to help me work with you better_

I'm a morning person, expect the best from me in the mornings. For coding or meetings, morning is my time. 

I usually have a very stable schedule with normal working hours. I don't work over night or on the weekends.

#### Pros

1. I'm not a genius, but extremely dedicated. What I lack in inteligence I make up with effort and good willing.
2. I like trouble and hard tasks. Those tasks that no one wants, that's what I have for breakfast.
3. I like to please the user and I'll try to implement every single crazy feature one may want.
4. I'm a coward and for that reason I usually speak the truth.
5. I don't mind for smiles and soft words, please don't bother with my feelings as long as you tell me the truth.
6. I'm a good listener. 
7. I like to learn, which means I can take a lot of frustration and anger. I'll chew rocks, if there's a drop of water inside.

#### Cons

1. I'm not a genius. Please be patient.
2. I tend to overthink things and my taste for complexities sometimes leads me off road.
3. I like to talk and I can spend all the time possible into discussions. The more useless the better. But I need to go heads down to get things done, and I often take too much to respond to messages.
4. My willingness to help can easily be abused. Please don't do that to me.
5. I forget things unless I write them down.
6. I'm stubborn, you might need to tell me the same thing more than once. I'm not that a good listener?
7. I'm not super carefuly and sometimes over confident. In other words, I may blew things up.

### Hobbies and interests 

I like astronomy and I've built my own telescope. There's some ambiguity around that telescope, which is that it was built so I could look at the stars and planets, but sometimes I look more at the telescope itself than the sky. It's my personal struggle between the machine and the contemplation, between expanding myself in the sky and trying to compress the sky inside my head. 

I also like martial arts and I've been practing a few different arts in the last 7 years. What I liked the most is boxing and that's what I've been training in the past 3 years. I can take punches. 

Poetry and books. I have this hobby called "thinking" since I was 14yo., and you can find my late in the night doing nothing, sitting and still, but it's not that I'm doing nothing, I'm just practing this hobby of thinking of things.

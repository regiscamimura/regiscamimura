### Hi there üëã

I'm a quiet patient stubborn guy, as most developers have to be to some degree. I've been working in web development since 2004, but still aware that there are  many things yet to be learned.

I'm a husband and a father of two. It's also helpful to be a quiet, patient, and stubborn guy on that front. Wife and kids may disagree.

### User manual

_Here are some ways to help me work with you better_

I'm a morning person, expect the best from me in the mornings. For coding or meetings, morning is my time. 

I usually have a very stable schedule with regular working hours. I usually don't work overnight or on the weekends.

I like to contribute and care about results. I'm not the kind of person who goes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and says "Whatever". Please don't tell me to just do as I'm told and follow instructions, I don't take that very well. I work better if I understand the problem I'm working on and if I can think of a solution myself, or at least contribute to the solution.

Also, I like to talk to users and understand the real-world scenario. Too much abstraction is no virtue, let's not work on imaginary scenarios. Kudos ![@wadewilliams](https://github.com/wadewilliams).

#### Pros

1. I'm not a genius, but very dedicated. What I lack in intelligence I make up with effort and goodwill.
2. I like trouble and hard tasks. Those tasks that no one wants, that's what I have for breakfast.
3. I like to please the user and I'll try to implement every single crazy feature one may want.
4. I'm a coward and for that reason, I usually speak the truth.
5. I don't mind for smiles and soft words, please don't bother with my feelings as long as you tell me the truth.
6. I'm a good listener. 
7. I like to learn, which means I can take a lot of frustration and anger. I'll chew a rock if there's a single drop of water inside it.

#### Cons

1. I'm not a genius. Please be patient.
2. I tend to overthink things and my taste for complexity sometimes leads me off-road.
3. I like to talk and I can spend all the time possible in discussions. The more useless the better. But I need to go heads down to get things done, and I often take too much to respond to messages.
4. My willingness to help can easily be abused. Please don't do that to me.
5. I forget things unless I write them down. And sometimes I forget to write things. And sometimes I'll lose the paper where I wrote them. I'm trying.
6. I'm stubborn, you might need to tell me the same thing more than once. I'm not that good of a listener?
7. I'm not super careful and sometimes overconfident. In other words, I may blow things up.


### Personal interests

#### Things I like

Poetry and books. I have had this hobby called "thinking" since I was 14yo., and you can find me late in the night doing nothing, sitting and still, but it's not that I'm doing nothing, I'm just practicing this hobby of thinking of things.

#### Things I dislike

Mobile devices, Bluetooth things, and frogs.
